## About

LeetCode is a platform for honing algorithm skills through solving coding challenges. This project aims to provide solutions to a variety of these challenges in different programming languages. By contributing to this repository, you can:
- Practice different algorithms and data structures.
- Learn from others' solutions.
- Improve your problem-solving skills.
- Build a portfolio of code solutions.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from everyone! Here's how you can get started:

1. **Fork the repository** by clicking the 'Fork' button on the top right of this page.
2. **Clone your forked repository** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FliriElias/leetcode.git` 

3.  **Choose a problem** from LeetCode that hasn't been solved yet.
4.  **Create a new branch** for the problem you are solving:
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `git checkout -b your-branch-name` 
    
5.  **Solve the problem** in your preferred programming language. Make sure to:
    -   Include comments to explain your approach.
    -   Test your solution with sample inputs to ensure correctness.
6.  **Add your solution** to the appropriate folder in the repository. If a folder for your language doesn't exist, feel free to create one.
7.  **Commit** your changes:
    
    bashCopy code example:
    
    `git add .`
  `git commit -m "Add solution for LeetCode problem XYZ in Python"` 
    
8.  **Push** your changes to your forked repository:
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `git push origin your-branch-name` 
    
9.  **Create a Pull Request** (PR) to the `main` branch of this repository. In your PR, describe the problem you solved and include any relevant details.

Once your PR is merged, your solution will be added to the project, and you'll have contributed to the community's pool of LeetCode solutions!

## Directory Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

-   `problems/`: Contains subfolders for each LeetCode problem.
    -   `problem1/`
        -   `solution1.cpp`
    -   `problem2/`
        -   `solution1.cpp`
    -   `...`
-   `languages/`: Contains folders for different programming languages.
    -   `python/`
    -   `java/`
    -   `javascript/`
    -   `cpp/`
    -   `...`

Feel free to organize your solutions under the appropriate language folder and LeetCode problem folder.
